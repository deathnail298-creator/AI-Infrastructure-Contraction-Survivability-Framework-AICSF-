# Phase 0 — Core Principle

## The spine
**AI infrastructure must be able to contract safely, not only expand quickly.**

## What that implies (high level)
- pauses must be executable without chaos
- partial idle must be survivable
- “slower” must not automatically mean “failing”
- control must stay internal as long as possible

## Plain-English summary
The point is not to avoid slowing down.  
The point is to slow down without losing control.  
Systems should be designed to brake, not only accelerate.
