# Phase 0 — Purpose

## Goal
Define a simple framework for large AI infrastructure operators to **slow down safely** if investor expectations change, without panic, collapse, or forced asset destruction.

This is not about growth. It is about **damage control before damage compounds**.

## Why it exists
Large infrastructure programs are hard to reverse. If the outside world suddenly demands “prove what pays for itself,” companies that can’t slow down cleanly can lose control fast.

The main risk is not slower growth.  
The main risk is **uncontrolled reversal**.

## What “success” looks like in Phase 0
Phase 0 is successful if readers can:
- accept slowdown as a valid operating state
- understand that deceleration is an engineering/structure problem (not just a PR problem)
- see why preparation must start before pressure becomes public

## Plain-English summary
Phase 0 explains why a safe slowdown plan matters before anyone is forced to slow down.  
It does not tell anyone what to build or buy.  
It exists to prevent self-inflicted damage during an inevitable shift.
