# Phase 0 — Problem Statement

AI infrastructure spending is front-loaded and hard to reverse.

If investors shift from:
- “grow fast”  
to
- “show what pays for itself”

…then operators that cannot slow down cleanly face a **non-linear failure risk**.

## The core problem
Most organizations build systems optimized for expansion.
Very few build systems optimized for **controlled contraction**.

When contraction is forced:
- decisions become reactive
- messaging becomes inconsistent
- internal teams thrash
- external parties gain control (investors, suppliers, customers)

## Plain-English summary
The problem is not that growth slows.  
The problem is that slowing down can break the system if it isn’t planned.  
This repo exists to make slowdown survivable.
