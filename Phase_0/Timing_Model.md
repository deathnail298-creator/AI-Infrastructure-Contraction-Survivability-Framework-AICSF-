# Phase 0 — Timing Model

## Timing assumption
This framework is most effective **before** public pressure forces action.

Early action looks planned. Late action looks like panic.

## Three windows
### Window A — Calm Period (best time)
Start immediately. Quiet preparation while nobody is watching.

### Window B — Wobble Period
Public signals appear: tougher questions, utilization concerns, tighter capital, delayed buyer expansion.

### Window C — Impact Period
External pressure is active. At this point, the goal is damage reduction, not “perfect planning.”

## Lead-time rule (best practice)
- **12–18 months lead time:** full benefit (quiet preparation + clean execution)
- **~6 months:** partial benefit (messier, but still reduces damage)
- **0–3 months:** mostly crisis management

## Plain-English summary
Start early if you want control.  
If you wait until the pressure is public, everything hurts more.  
This model is about buying a longer braking zone.
