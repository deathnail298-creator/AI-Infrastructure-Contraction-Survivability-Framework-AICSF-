# Phase 0 — Non-Claims (What this does NOT do)

This framework does NOT:
- predict market timing or investor sentiment shifts
- claim AI is a bubble
- recommend stopping AI investment
- evaluate any specific company, product, or balance sheet
- provide financial, legal, or investment advice
- tell any company how to run its business

## What this DOES do
It documents patterns that reduce damage when slowing down becomes necessary.

## Plain-English summary
This repo is not a forecast and not advice.  
It is a set of preparation patterns for safe slowdown.  
It helps reduce self-inflicted damage when conditions change.
