# Phase 0 — Scope Boundaries

## This repository covers
- framing the problem
- identifying failure modes
- defining preparation patterns
- timing windows and readiness steps
- guardrails to prevent misuse
- a clean handoff boundary

## This repository does not cover
- executing real capex changes
- renegotiating contracts
- workforce decisions
- operational restructuring
- company-specific implementation plans

## Why the boundary exists
Execution requires authority, contracts, legal review, and balance-sheet ownership. This repo is deliberately limited to what can be defined without those.

## Plain-English summary
This repo explains how to prepare for safe slowdown.  
It does not authorize real-world execution.  
When real cuts and contract changes begin, this repo is no longer the right tool.
