# Phase 0 — Failure Modes

If an organization has no safe contraction paths, sentiment shifts tend to produce these failures:

## Common failure modes
- **Stranded infrastructure:** capacity exists but can’t be justified or used profitably.
- **Forced utilization:** teams push workloads just to hide idle capacity, creating bad decisions.
- **Supplier stress:** delivery schedules and terms get renegotiated under pressure.
- **Customer confidence loss:** customers interpret slowdown as instability.
- **Messaging whiplash:** internal/external language changes abruptly, signaling panic.
- **Emergency restructuring:** decisions get made too late and too fast.

## Why these failures are “system failures”
They can happen even if the technology works.
They are caused by structure, commitments, and timing — not model quality.

## Plain-English summary
Without preparation, a slowdown tends to look like failure.  
That triggers panic behavior that makes the damage worse.  
These are avoidable failure patterns if contraction is designed in.
