# Phase 1 — Do-Not-Cross Boundaries

These are common mistakes that increase damage.

Do not:
- force usage just to hide idle capacity
- announce freezes before preparation is complete
- tie layoffs directly to slowdown messaging
- change language suddenly under pressure
- treat “pause” as “failure” internally

Why:
These actions trigger panic behavior and accelerate loss of control.

## Plain-English summary
These are the ways companies make a slowdown worse.  
Avoid them and you reduce damage even if you can’t avoid slowdown.  
If you cross these lines, this framework won’t help.
