# Phase 1 — Role Ownership Map (Minimum Viable)

If ownership is unclear, nothing happens.

## Finance
- owns classification of pausable vs non-pausable commitments
- owns internal definitions of “acceptable idle” from a reporting perspective

## Infrastructure / Operations
- owns making idle survivable (thermal, operational, maintenance assumptions)
- owns defining clean pause points in delivery/build sequences

## Product / Research
- owns decoupling progress metrics from raw build volume
- owns capability narratives that remain true during slowdown

## Executives
- own timing decisions
- authorize pause execution as policy (not a last-minute reaction)

## Plain-English summary
Someone has to own each part or it won’t happen.  
This is the minimum map so the work doesn’t die in ambiguity.  
If one role won’t own it, the plan will fail under stress.
