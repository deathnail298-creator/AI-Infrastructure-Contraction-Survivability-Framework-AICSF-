# Phase 1 — Handoff Trigger (Scope Boundary)

This repository ends when:
- real capex cuts are required
- customer contracts must be renegotiated
- workforce restructuring is being considered

At that point, authority must transfer to operators with execution, legal, and financial control.

This repo authorizes **no execution beyond preparation**.

## Plain-English summary
When real cuts and renegotiations start, this repo has done its job.  
After that, it must be handed to the people with legal and financial authority.  
This boundary prevents misuse and scope creep.
