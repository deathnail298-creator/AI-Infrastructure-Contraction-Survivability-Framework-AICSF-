# Phase 1 — Step-by-Step Readiness Ladder

This ladder is ordered. Each step makes the next step possible.

## Step 1 — Classify what’s stoppable
Create a simple internal list:
- can pause anytime
- can pause with notice
- cannot pause

## Step 2 — Make idle non-scary
Define “idle is allowed” internally:
- idle capacity is buffer, not failure
- partial utilization is normal
- don’t force usage just to protect optics

## Step 3 — Separate product progress from build-out
Stop tying product success to raw infrastructure growth.
Tie it to: quality, reliability, coverage of real workloads.

## Step 4 — Pre-write slowdown language
Prepare consistent wording before stress:
- “optimizing build timing”
- “matching capacity to named demand”
- “improving ROI density”
(Use whatever language fits your org, but pre-decide it.)

## Step 5 — Install pause points
Define where growth can pause cleanly:
- procurement gates
- build phases
- rollout milestones

## Step 6 — Run a tabletop drill
Dry run:
- what pauses first?
- who decides?
- what gets communicated?
- what is explicitly NOT changed?

## Step 7 — Shift from expansion mode to selective mode
Only when the wall is clearly forming:
- stop “anticipated demand” expansion first
- continue only for named workloads / committed demand
- keep optional builds optional

## Plain-English summary
This is a step-by-step “braking system.”  
Do the early steps while nobody is watching.  
Later steps work only if earlier steps were done first.
