# Phase 1 — Readiness Checklist (Yes / No / Not Yet)

1. Have we classified what can pause?
2. Can idle capacity exist without alarms or panic?
3. Do we have pre-written slowdown language?
4. Are pause points defined?
5. Is product progress decoupled from spend/build volume?
6. Have we rehearsed a sentiment flip (tabletop drill)?
7. Do we know the first pause action we would take?
8. Are suppliers prepared for cadence changes (not cancellations)?
9. Are executives aligned on restraint language?
10. Do we know when this framework stops being enough?

## Plain-English summary
This is a quick internal “are we ready to brake?” check.  
If most answers are “No,” you are not ready.  
If most answers are “Yes,” you can slow down without chaos.
