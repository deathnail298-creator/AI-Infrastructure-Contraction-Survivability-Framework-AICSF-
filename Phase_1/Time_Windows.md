# Phase 1 — Time Windows (Operational Use)

Use the same three windows from Phase 0, but with actions attached.

## Window A — Calm Period actions (start now)
- classify what can pause vs cannot
- make “idle is allowed” real internally
- decouple product progress from build volume
- pre-write slowdown language
- define pause points
- run a tabletop drill

## Window B — Wobble Period actions (increase strength)
Trigger when 2–3 signals appear:
- tougher analyst/investor questions about payback
- repeated utilization questions
- tighter capital / higher cost of capital
- customers delay expansions/renewals
- suppliers tighten terms

Actions:
- stop “future demand” builds first
- shift to “named demand” gating
- normalize throttling / intermittent duty cycles
- execute pauses as planned policy (not reaction)

## Window C — Impact Period actions
- execute the pre-defined pause plan
- avoid sudden messaging changes
- avoid forced usage to hide idle
- hand off to full execution authority when required

## Plain-English summary
Calm period = prepare quietly.  
Wobble period = start real deceleration steps.  
Impact period = execute the plan and avoid panic behavior.
