# Phase 1 — Scope (Permission to Prepare)

Phase 1 defines **testable preparation steps** without executing real changes.

## What Phase 1 includes
- steps that can be done early without “panic signaling”
- a readiness ladder (ordered actions)
- role ownership (who does what)
- “do not cross” boundaries (how orgs make things worse)
- a short internal checklist
- a hard handoff trigger

## What Phase 1 avoids
- detailed company-specific plans
- financial targets or forecasts
- implementation directives

## Plain-English summary
Phase 1 is about getting ready to slow down safely.  
It is preparation, not execution.  
It turns the idea into a practical internal playbook.
